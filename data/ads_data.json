First Tuesday in November! KY, VA, MS, and more get out the vote! For the rest of us it\u2019s time to get talking 11.3.2020. We still don\u2019t fully know what happened with the last presidential election. How the Republican Party sold out to Fox and its owners and ultimately arrived on the same page as Russia is one for the history books to work out. What we do know is that Election Day 11.3.2020 will ...be the most important election of our lifetimes where we will finally be given the opportunity to put right all that went wrong four years earlier. Election Day 2020 will be our chance to prove that America isn\u2019t done being America yet. What\u2019s at stake in these next 12 months is no less than the very Soul of America. Let's use this clear vision year of 2020 to add another great chapter to the history of our county. So many have given so much to give us, and the world, this gift that is America. The goodness that is America, and the hope it brings, simply cannot be allowed to perish. Not on our watch. We each must find our way to use our voice to share what this election means to all those we think will listen and maybe even some who we don\u2019t think will listen. People can surprise you. For us at Penzeys our next step is our new Choose Love Gift Boxes. From the Penzey family artwork to the words on the Choose Love cards inside to all of the amazing spices in between, I like them a lot.  In this day when the Republican Party has been overtaken by corruption and cruelty, the Choose Love boxes may well hold what we hope to be the message for our time. When it comes to children and schools -Choose Love. When it comes to protecting our environment-Choose Love. When it comes to how we treat any one of us who finds ourelves outside of any majority-Choose Love. These are wonderful boxes and for their introduction, through Wednesday at midnight Pacific they are half-price if you so choose. Or full price, too. A week ago I got an email not quite like one I\u2019ve seen before and I get lots of emails. It was from a couple who, after reading in their newspaper about what we are trying to do to with our \u201cImpeachment ads\u201d on Facebook, drove a long way to visit one of our stores. They sent a photo of the twelve jars they purchased (they don\u2019t shy away from spicy). But they also purchased a $100 gift card \u201cthat may or may not be redeemed\u201d to support what we are trying to do. Very cool. Very-very cool, but please if you want to support us, one way or another please-please put that gift card to use.  People enjoying tasty food and conversation around the dinner table are where the real change our country needs will be set in motion. We are what we are because our customers have shown us the value in caring about others and all the goodness that caring sets in motion. The holidays are almost upon us. It would mean so much to us if you could use this holiday season to share the seasonings that help us set more of the kindness and caring of cooking in motion. So for full-price Choose Love boxes click here:  And for half-price Choose Love boxes click here:   It\u2019s your choice and I\u2019m expecting and hoping to see most go at half price. You being able to give twice as many people a Choose Love Box with its Choose Love message card is a really good thing. But if you are going to buy just one of the big 15-jar boxes for your mom and money isn\u2019t that big of an issue, please go right ahead and pay full price and we will put the difference to good use. Or maybe a 25% discount is more your style; buy one at half price and one at full price and there you go. Yes, this offer is also good in our stores. At checkout just let the friendly Penzeys person helping you know which price works for you. If you are purchasing online at penzeys.com here is the link again for half-prices boxes $14.90\u2014$29.90:  And for full priced Choose Love boxes $29.95 to $59.95:   And seriously, honestly, there is no judgment here. We trust you to know what is right for you. These are pretty wonderful boxes, you are pretty wonderful people, the combination of you giving one of these boxes to someone you care about gives us the real chance to grow what we do. Please use the discount to give as many as you can to those you know. Thanks. And even if you aren\u2019t in a place to spend money right now please check out our Choose Love card that comes with each box and says things like: \u201c...And at the end of the day we ask you to CHOOSE LOVE because someone somewhere tonight needs America to be for them, too.\u201d To see the card just click here:  And if you haven\u2019t signed up for our Penzeys email list now is a great time to take the plunge. Our emails are where all the fun is and we can do so much more with links and great images of tasty food. Plus it saves us a ton of money when it comes to reaching you, freeing us up to spread further and wider our message of all the good set in motion when you care about others. Your likes, comments and shares make a real difference in these times. But signing up for our list and encouraging others to do the same is the most valuable thing you can do to counter those who want to shout us down for speaking the truth about what\u2019s happened to the Republican Party.  To sign up for Penzeys email list just click this link. It is surprisingly easy:  And if you were on our email list Monday morning you would have received these two letters under the subject line of: 2 Letters\u2014What making a difference looks like. And with the header of: 1)\u201ca senior executive at a fortune 200 company\u201d with an F-Bomb! 2) a good person. 1: Bill, I\u2019m pretty middle of the road politically - your post is the most ridiculous thing I have ever read from the CEO of a consumer company.  I\u2019m a senior executive at a fortune 200 company and can\u2019t imagine what kind of a person would write such nonsensical garbage ... Bill, respectfully, you grind nutmeg.  I can buy spices from anyone and so can everyone else - we\u2019re done, everyone I know is done with you.  My family all lives in the Midwest and my spice rack is literally full of Penzey\u2019s.  I am literally dumping it into the garbage and will never step foot into your store again after reading such insane left wing nonsense.  And then curating the comments to make people look supportive - come on.  Regardless of your political views, in middle America, running a consumer products company - you\u2019re seriously a f*****g idiot.   Best of luck! 2: Dear Bill, I just wanted to let you know that there are Republicans in America who are NOT Trump supporters, or as I like to claim Human Scum, as per The Donald. I\u2019ve been a Republican all my life and never liked Trump. He is completely without morals, a horrible business man, and totally narcissistic. He isn\u2019t a true Republican and I just can\u2019t understand how the Republicans let him co-opt the Party.   Thank you for risking profits by taking a stand against this dangerous, corrupt, and criminal President and his sycophants.   Sincerely, Steve F. In the first letter the f*****g was our doing; he really did spell it all out. With our email, where we can make anything a link, we made the ***** part of the word a clickable link that leads straight to the half-priced 9-jar Choose Love Box, so you could click on the literal obscenity of our times and turn it into a gift of Love for someone who still might go either way in next year\u2019s election.  It\u2019s not as much fun, but you could still find the half-priced ($19.90) 9-jar for giving here *****  Or if you wanted to really show him, you could send the full-priced ($39.95) 9-jar version which does actually qualify for free regular shipping here #@*%!  Trust us, we will find a way to put the difference of those boxes sold at full price to good use. But seriously, the best possible outcome to this offer is you giving these Choose Love boxes to twice as many people this holiday season. These are really nice boxes and if you want to reach as many people as economically as possible, right now is the time to visit penzeys.com and do it. These boxes hold the secret recipe of how capitalism can join the fight in the defense of democracy. Make other businesses envious of the success we are having and watch how the world changes overnight.  And in all the fun and excitement please don\u2019t forget Steve F. And his letter. The times are changing. Yes, some are doing all they can to make sure the cruelty and corruption that have taken hold of the Republican Party in this time of unlimited political spending never let go. But the Steves of America are the real story, they are the ones with the power to move the polls. And I did share with the author of the first letter that at the time of his email our previous post did indeed have 4,300 angry faces and 6,400 mean laughing faces, but it also had 133,000 likes and 28,800 loves. Kindness really is the currency of Cooks.  And please don\u2019t give up on all conservatives and republicans. People can surprise you. Many have never supported this administration or what their party has become and have finally reached that point where they refuse to stay quiet any longer. Please send these people some love. Imagine if compassionate conservatism made a comeback but this time left behind pretending privilege doesn\u2019t exist. Positive feedback is everything. Don\u2019t miss this chance to give them some.  And to those who fell for the Fox propaganda and voted for all this, please don\u2019t make your vote a life sentence. Just take responsibility for your actions, find your way to make amends and move on. It\u2019s not so hard. The power to become something better has always been in your hands. Please use it. Act now. Don\u2019t delay. Thanks for having the kindness to cook. Thanks for letting us be us.

Now that we\u2019re FINALLY on a roll with the renovations, we will be giving you routine updates on our progress. The recent run of nice weather has really helped us get some good momentum. We\u2019ve taken some pictures to show you how it\u2019s going. - Photo #1: First up: the bar area. As you can see, we not only have a foundation for the new bar, but we have the beginnings of the walls. The roof comes in two weeks, and then we\u2019ll REALLY see some quick progress. - Photo #2: As indicated in previous posts, as we peered into walls and the ceiling of the kitchen and order area over the past months, we found some pretty big surprises that have required us to do more work. This is a view of the old kitchen area (in the background, where the man is standing), taken from the former storage area. The order area is off to the right of the photo. You might find it interesting to know that the columns of the original gas station building, built in the early 1930s, are visible \u2013 one is to the right, with the red ladder leaning up against it, and the other is to the left of the man. It\u2019s been pretty neat to peel back all of the layers and see the original building. We\u2019re installing new plumbing as you can see in the concrete trenches in the floor. We\u2019re excited to give the kitchen crew an entirely new kitchen/storage area, completely rebuilt and re-organized into one large, efficient space. This will not only provide them with a much-improved environment \u2013 it will significantly increase our ability to get orders out quickly and accurately. Have no fear, Chris Madrids friends, our grill wasn\u2019t damaged and will return! - We know that this process has taken longer than anticipated, and we thank you for your patience and encouragement throughout the months! Once we put it all back together, we firmly believe that you\u2019ll hardly notice the \u201cnew\u201d behind the walls. Chris\u2019s daughter, Lisa Waller, is doing a great job helping us think through how we put everything back, as we\u2019re all fully committed to making sure the spirit of Chris Madrids will live on\u2026 So long as we don\u2019t get a lot more rain, we\u2019ll be able to speed up the rebuilding process. In the meantime, we hope to still see you at the food truck, because no fire can stop the Macho!

That we still have the ability to do that with votes is why this election is so very-very important. Thank you for a...ll your support and interest this election season. These days, posts here from businesses really are what ads used to be. Facebook has bills; it\u2019s fair. But with your interest, clicks, likes, shares, and especially your comments, in the lead up to today\u2019s election you\u2019ve made our posts act almost like they were solar powered, funding themselves to reach far beyond the places posts like ours ever get to travel. Thank you greatly for this.  Once this election is over there\u2019s a good chance our posts won\u2019t likely reach you nearly as often. If you like the feeling of hope our reality of cooking brings and the regular reminder that you really are not alone in caring about others, there\u2019s much to be said for signing up for our Voice Of Cooking emails. From our lifetime around Cooks, we\u2019ve learned they\u2019re awesome. Spending more time with Cooks is always a good thing to do. You can sign up for Penzeys Voice Of Cooking here:   And with your support we\u2019ve come a long way. Our \u201cTo Cook is to Care. To Care is to Vote\u201d really worked as a counter to the anger and fear-based voter turnout messages of the Republican Party. It seems the decency of Cooks, the power of cooking to share the values of compassion, and the goodness set in motion when we take care of others has hit all the right notes in this time when those on the right have been marching to a very different tune.  With all this going on, when first discussing what should go in our final 2018 Campaign for Kindness election offer gift box, the Kind pin and the Embrace Hope pin were clear first choices and I thought the Heal the World magnet would be a nice addition if possible. Upon hearing of the Synagog shooting in our old Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, the Heal the World message became a must. For us, it\u2019s so clear Cooks really do heal the world. Their day after day kindness and compassion are pretty much the glue that keeps the human race from falling apart. A million years ago we started to cook. Over tens of thousands of generations cooking taught us true strength is not the ability to drive others away, true strength is the ability to welcome others in. This ability to gather others around the fire is what ultimately gave humans the responsibility of leadership of the animal world. And it was America\u2019s willingness to let others in that ultimately brought us leadership in the world. Since we first introduced our Heal the World art, I\u2019ve had many good conversations and emails with people of Jewish faith about how healing the world is even more than a core belief in their faith, it\u2019s a call to action. That the members of the Tree of Life Synagogue should have become targeted by fear and hate for their kindness and compassion brings such great sadness and leaves us all with so much healing to do.  I have no doubt in the strength of their community or in their ability to overcome. But it is time for us all as Americans to admit their community is our community and for us all to rise up to stop the hate at the heart of this. It\u2019s time to admit that the fear and hate is not being generated by some fringe group, but instead by the President of our United States. How much longer will we go on saying what he is doing makes no sense? How much longer will we act like his lack of desire to create support from a majority of voters is somehow him not understanding how America works?  The time has come to admit that what the President is doing is completely logical if he is no longer concerned with having the support of We the People and has his eyes set instead on the far more absolute rule that comes through the power made possible with violence and intimidation. History shows again and again the incredible cost in human lives when those who choose the pathway of fear, anger and hate are left unchecked. That we still have the ability to do that with votes is why this election is so very-very important.   And yes, Heal the World. It\u2019s time to get back to the humanity at the heart of what actually makes America great. Let\u2019s get back to welcoming in our share of the world\u2019s refugees. You might ask: \u201cWhy should it be our job to Heal the World?\u201d Because as Americans we\u2019ve been given the gift of what, until now, has been a life free from fascism. It is a gift given to the vast majority of us by those who allowed the open immigration that let in our wretched refuse ancestors by the millions.  Ellis Island alone took in a couple of these caravans we are now supposed to be so frightened of every single day. If you could walk up three flights of stairs, congratulations you were a legal American resident. With how far they\u2019ve already come, these caravan people seem more than capable of making it up three flights of stairs, which is good because we need them.  India and China are not standing still. With future economies based as much on population as on production if we are to be competitive in the future we need more Americans. We have 1/7 the population density of Germany. We have the room, we have the need; the time has come to do the right thing. Vote today! And take everyone you can to vote with you. This one matters.  Today is the final day for our free with $5 purchase, $28.95 value Hope and Kindness Gift Box! We\u2019ve arrived at our last pitch of our Choose Kindness 2018 election with our Embrace Hope pin, Kind Heart pin, Heal the World Bumper/Refrigerator magnet, and half-cup jar of our really tasty Roasted Garlic all packed into a happy little yellow Penzeys box.

When she was only 12, Elana was visiting her grandmother and happened upon a basket of soap, lotion, and shampoo samples that the elderly woman had brought home from hotels. Hmm, thought Elana; there must be hundreds of these little bottles and packages in people\u2019s homes, unopened, taking up space. And there are ...so many people who probably can\u2019t afford to buy these items. So Elana started writing letters\u2014to hotels, to companies, to local businesses, conventions, anyplace that might have leftover goods to donate. \u201cAt the beginning,\u201d said her mother, \u201cshe thought if she tried hard, she\u2019d get maybe 1,000 pieces. She had no way of anticipating the tremendous response.\u201d The tremendous response included toiletries from Holiday Inn and Marriott, perfumes from Estee Lauder, and toothbrushes and toothpaste from Colgate. Elana also set up collection boxes all over town\u2014in the library, the Jewish Community Center, synagogue, and churches. Within two years, she had collected over 50,000 of these products\u2014in addition to sewing kits, nail files, shoe polish, towels, baby lotion, aspirin, and facial tissue\u2014and distributed them to people in shelters for the homeless and to battered women, troubled teens, and the elderly. Elana braved peers who thought that this was a weird way for a kid to spend her time. She gave speeches to dozens of audiences, appealing for donations. She wrote hundreds of letters seeking collection sites, distribution points, and potential donors. She made and delivered collection boxes and regularly harvested the donations in them. And she wrote and sent out how-to kits so other people could replicate the system she created. Along the way, the little girl learned a lot about the poverty system. \u201cDid you know that it\u2019s legal to buy caviar with food stamps, but you can\u2019t buy toothpaste?\u201d she asks. Most importantly, she learned and taught others that even a child, with only an allowance and babysitting money, can make a real contribution. When she describes her efforts, \u201cpeople realize that you don\u2019t have to do that much to make a big difference.\u201d \u201cAnyone could do it, if I could,\u201d she says, \u201cand I wish people in other places would try.\u201d UPDATE: Elana Erdstein Perry is an associate rabbi at Atlanta\u2019s Temple Sinai, and co-chair for Tzedek Georgia, a Reform Jewish advocacy group where she helps to develop initiatives in education, women's programming and social justice. She\u2019s President of the Greater Atlanta Reform Clergy Association. In the wider Atlanta community, she serves on the Board and Clergy Advisory Group for MACoM \u2013 Metro Atlanta Community Mikvah, and on the Steering Committee for Outcry: Interfaith Voices Against Gun Violence.

I think it depends on the location. The staff members and nurses are amazing! They are always sweet and friendly and always willing to help.  I was hospitalized for 2 weeks while I was pregnant with my daughter and I loved all of the nurses. They would all talk to me and keep me calm, share there experiences with me, went out of there way to keep me comfortable. After I was discharged from the hospital I ...was still staying there because my daughter was in the NICU and when they would see me in the halls they would ask about me and my daughter to see how we were doing. I was staying as a courtesy stay and I had a nurse who would still bring me food to make sure I was taken care of.  The doctors werent as great. Some were but they were horrible at communicating with each other! I had a new doctor every 12 hours and everyone had different opinions and different ways of doing things. I had doctors who were trying to keep me in the hospital and another one who walked in trying to discharge me (after multiple doctors told me I would be in for at least another 2 weeks) and didn't talk to the previous doctor (or nurses for that matter) and didn't happen to notice the desats on the fetal monitor. Just a couple days later I ended up with severe hypertension (in stroke levels) and had to be induced for the safety of me and my daughter. If we would have actually been discharged who knows what would have happened.... My daughter was born premature and was in the NICU for a month and the nurses and doctors in there were absolutely amazing! They kept me involved in everything, made me feel included, allowed me to help with anything i was able to. They took amazing care of my daughter and i am forever grateful to them! That hospital also allowed me a courtesy stay so for 3 of the 4 weeks i was staying in the parent room or a hospital room so I could be close to my daughter. Above was all in the Modesto hospital in Kaiser. There billing department sucks! I cant tell you how many times ive received bills for extra charges even after confirming my copays beforehand. They even coded something differently so they can say the charge was for additional testing (that she didn't receive) Some as small as $20 all the way up to charging me $500 when they shouldn't have. Ive had multiple claims with billing. And then theres Manteca ER.... I wouldn't recommend them for anything! I took my 18 month old daughter in for a head injury. The doctor shined a light in her eyes and asked us questions and that was the extent of his exam. He told us she had a slight concussion, he did not think she needed a CT scan because there was a less then 1% chance she had a brain bleed and he didn't recommend it. He said he just wanted to monitor her for a couple hours and then we could leave. They left us on a hospital bed in the hallway, we weren't even able to be in a room. I figured her head might hurt so I asked the Dr if she could have ibuprofen which he said yes. I later found out that Ibuprofen is extremely dangerous with head injuries and concussions because its a blood thinner and could cause/worsen a brain bleed. Before she was discharged I asked if we should make a follow up appointment with her pediatrician and he said no, not unless she started showing more symptoms. He again told us he didn't recommend a CT scan because it would expose her to radiation and she looked fine to him. I've never had a concussion, I've never been around someone with one so i had no idea what to do, what they should normally do and your supposed to be able to trust the doctor! A week later my daughter still had concussion symptoms so I called an advice nurse. She was blown away! She couldn't believe he didnt do a CT scan when the head injury was bad enough that she stopped breathing and passed out. She then told me how dangerous ibuprofen was and she doesnt understand why he would tell us not to do a follow up appointment, there should always be a follow up especially in that kind of situation. She set a phone appointment with a pediatrician for the next day who said the same things the advice nurse had said.  So the ER doctor didnt follow proper protocols, didn't do a full exam, diagnosed a slight concussion when it was worse then slight, and then gave me advice that could have killed my daughter.  So Kaiser can be really great, i love all of my doctors at the Stockton location, the Modesto hospital L;D department was great except for the lack of communication. And there NICU was beyond amazing! And they can be really bad like Manteca and not do there jobs and give you advice that could seriously harm you.\u201d Jenn Griffin", "fin_ctg": "This ad is about health", "targets": "Age: 19 and older\nMinAge: 19\nState: California\nCity: \"Sacramento\""}, {"id": "6108549198397", "title": "Feeding America", "page": "https://www.facebook.com/FeedingAmerica/", "paid_for_by": "Feeding America", "categories_1": "Nonprofit Organization", "fr": 0.0, "label": "str_np", "text": "Help ensure no family has to go hungry.

If you are not up on the messaging of the right, they\u2019ve arrived at that point where, if you can\u2019t run on who you are, or run against who your opposition actually is, your only real choice is to make up something about the other side and run against that. So the idea here is that those who oppose the Republican Party\u2019s open embrace of Nationalism are all secret Communists. Enjoy! \u201cDear Comrade Bill, Any time you are ready to move to a communist or socialist country like North Korea or the Soviet Union, please let me know. I will not only pack your bags for you but I will carry them to the tanker you would be departing on. Good luck with human rights in your new country.\u201d This just makes me smile. The whole notion of the tanker and the image of him carrying my bags to the boat for me. You can bet these would not be pieces of luggage with wheels, no sir. These would be suit cases with handles, the type you pick up and set down. I bet we would both be wearing hats with brims... Good stuff! Normally I don\u2019t respond, but I do think this notion of those who won\u2019t abandon the values of America to embrace the Nationalism of the Republican Party are somehow un-American should whenever possible be challenged. And maybe I should have taken a little more time and crafted a warmer response, but here you go: \u201cFunny. We are the Spice Business, we invented Capitalism. Any time you want to experience it in its purest form we will be here to take your money.\u201d And it\u2019s true. You can look it up. The fact is that so much of what modern life is was set in motion by the desire for Spices. Growing up in the business, going off on my own, for decades I thought that all these major events tied to Spices were coincidences. The smell of Cloves greeting those who opened King Tut\u2019s tomb\u2014coincidence. The creation of Capitalism followed by the creation of the Stock Market\u2014side-by-side coincidences. Why the pilgrims, right after their first Thanksgiving, set themselves to making money\u2014coincidence. Why America was \u201cdiscovered\u201d by Europeans in the first place\u2014total coincidence. Or maybe not. We created Capitalism 400 years ago, and that was a big event, but the main event happened roughly 999,600 years earlier when we shared our first cooked meal together. More than anything, what makes us us is that we are the animals who cook. Over that millennia of millennia, our cooking and sharing meals together shaped us, evolved us, into what we are today. And where what we cook is the body, how we flavor it is the soul, and that soul means more to us than money. The flavors that tie us to where we are from, that we then pass on to those who become the future, mean everything to us. That we value Spices more than we value money can be used in a lot of ways, and as history has shown, not all of them good. At Penzeys we keep trying to do our part to bend it all a little bit more towards justice. Along those lines I think it\u2019s worth noting that it wasn\u2019t Oregano, or Cumin, or even Black Pepper that gave Capitalism its birth, it was the Baking Spices. And the thing is, back then there weren\u2019t that many bakeries. Capitalism was in reality set in motion by the very human desire to use the fruits of our labor to make the tasty treats we give away to the people in our lives even more meaningful. The truth is, Capitalism was born to be side-by-side with our humanity. They continue to do their best work when they stay that way.  So today and tomorrow, great deals on the Baking Spices that set Capitalism and so much more of our history in motion. Coincidence? You be the judge. One thing I can tell you is, with the way Penzeys has been rocking Capitalism of late, and with the way Cooks have a tendency to wait for the last moment to order, by midnight Thursday, we will most likely be buried in orders.

I respect you when you are right, and have no patience when you give up your values to unearned race-based praise. ...Still, the cliff you are now dropping off of with this week\u2019s events is too steep for anyone to face alone. They fooled you, and shame on them for that. But then you let them fool you again, and again, and again. You and I know what that means. But always remember, you are not alone.  The good news is that you were raised with the strength to take responsibility for your actions. Now\u2019s the time to use that strength to put things right. It won\u2019t be easy.

This is my story. I'm Bart from the Netherlands. I\u2019ve had a smooth upbringing. Parents are still together (married for over 45 years), gave lots of love to me and my older brother, and paid for my education. But\u2026 I had different ideas than my family about life, education, and the path I wanted to take. I never really felt understood or taken seriously as the youngest member of the family. This caused a lot of struggle when I was younger which resulted in arguments, disappointments, and more. This, in turn, not only caused a lot of stress for me, but also for my parents and brother. I wanted to explain to them why I did what I did...why I wanted to take a different path than my brother and others around me. But they never really understood. They told me I was a rebel. When I was a bit older, I got to the point where I felt this connection with my family was never going to change and I would just have to live with it. BUT... At that time, I started working on my personal development and was learning a lot about myself, psychology, and human nature. Through this, I began to notice the situation with my family wasn't about me and that there wasn\u2019t anything \u201cwrong\u201d with me. My family didn\u2019t understand me and we never had meaningful conversations about life together. But...I also didn't take the initiative to talk to them or ask them meaningful questions. Consequently, I was failing to include them in my life, too! Once I realized this, I had an idea that, later on, changed everything for me and the people around me. In December of 2016, a couple friends and I designed a question card game called \u2018Vertellis\u2019 - which means \u201ctell me more\u201d in Dutch. It contained questions like: What are you most proud of? / Who would you still like to thank? / What do you want to achieve next year? / What was your biggest mistake? On Christmas Eve, I played this handwritten game with my family for the first time. (I had to call it a \u2018game\u2019 because otherwise they never would have agreed to answer a series of deep questions with me during Christmas dinner\u2026 Smart move, I found out later :-) To my surprise, something really special happened that evening: There was so much understanding, love, and even a few tears during this memorable Christmas. We\u2019ve never felt so close to each other. This not only transformed my overall relationship with my family, but also enhanced their own relationship with themselves. My mission for having meaningful conversations ; spending time offline had begun.  Fast forward to today: I still play the \u2018Vertellis Holiday\u2019 game every year with my family ; friends. And together, with an amazing team, I\u2019ve ALSO decided to spread this idea around the world and inspire people to connect in a more meaningful way with their own families! Last year we inspired over a million people and our card game is now translated into 8 languages!!! We are SUPER proud of this. Thanks to thousands of happy fans, we currently have a 4.8 out of 5 star rating on Facebook and have been featured in major publications like Business Insider.

The president and first lady stood under a maple tree to greet some 1,700 guests. After shaking hands, attendees enjoyed ice cream, cake, coffee, and punch as the United States Marine Band serenaded the crowd.  One guest in particular stood out to the pre...sident. When Eisenhower laid eyes on eighty-year-old U.S. Army Major General Joseph W. Beacham he exclaimed, \u201cOh, brother, are you as tough as you used to be?\u201d Back in 1911, Beacham was the football coach at West Point. A young Eisenhower was a member of his football squad, playing the backfield. Although Eisenhower injured his knee during a tackle in his second year and gave up football, he still remembered his old coach some forty-two years later.  The Eisenhowers stood for two hours to shake the hand of every veteran present. The final man in line, twenty-two-year-old Private William D. Cochran, recently wounded in the Korean War, received an autograph from the president. Cochran presented him with a photograph of his late father and stepmother posing with then presidential candidate Eisenhower on the campaign trail. Eisenhower happily signed it for the young man.

Why wait until tomorrow to order? Visit us at penzeys.com now and take tomorrow as a holiday. And please let the CEOs and old-school capitalists in your life know that the New Capitalism is now here. They might well be like: \u201cHasn\u2019t the notion of businesses giving back to the community been around for a while now?\u201d Yes, we do that with our Penzeys Pepper, where for each jar sold or given away in an offer like this one, we give another to an organization that feeds those in need. But the New Capitalism isn\u2019t simply about giving back to the community it\u2019s about standing up for community in this time when the forces of unlimited political spending are seeking profit by destroying all the goodness Americans have worked for generations in building. Don\u2019t be surprised if they respond with a cringe-y face and something like: \u201cThat\u2019s politics, and that\u2019s bad for business.\u201d That\u2019s the old capitalism, with New Capitalism that old chestnut has done a 180. It\u2019s been a good nearly century-long run for cereal makers where the formula of buying supermarket shelf space for their sugared flakes coupled with big ad buys for animated proclamations of greatness guaranteed robust profits regardless of the economy. These days that style of marketing is a parrot that\u2019s shuffled off its mortal coil. To reach live customers with actual long-term potential it\u2019s time to turn the page. We now live in a time where the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling unlocked the doors to unlimited political spending and the Republican Party has become corrupted to its core by that spending. Every elected republican knows full well the reality of global warming but yet willingly furthers the destruction of our grandchildren\u2019s futures to increase the profits of their mega donors. The future won\u2019t forget this. From education, to equality, to heath care to virtually every other issue the republicans are standing for the wealthiest of the wealthy and against We the People. If your business relies on We the People it is time to give serious thought to standing up for them. The objectivity of the media in the 2016 presidential election opened the door for the corruption within the Republican Party to take hold of the party and the White House. The 2020 election won\u2019t be about objectivity, it will be about rightful outrage. My advice is don\u2019t get caught on the wrong side of that outrage. 2016 was all about the politics of unlimited political spending. 2020 is going to be all about consumers realizing they\u2019ve been wearing the ruby slippers all along. In our new social media world We the People hold all the power in our pocketbooks. There is a lot to be said for moving quickly to be worthy of their support. Waves can drag you under, but they can also lift you up. Seems to me the real fun with waves is in surfing them. Maybe as a CEO you\u2019re thinking that today\u2019s waves are out of your league and are giving thought to just letting them go by until a more peaceful tide rolls in. Sure, but what\u2019s your competition thinking? No loyalty you or any others in your field have built up means anything compared to standing with the people in next year\u2019s election. My advice is to figure out who you want to be and be it in a big way. And if I can\u2019t appeal to your heart, then please at least let me encourage you to do the math. Sure, if you\u2019re just running out the clock selling deep-fried fast-food meat sandwiches in super white majority suburbs, maybe the one-way ticket of supporting the racism and homophobia of this administration is where the fast buck lives. But for virtually every other business there really is no doubt where decades of future spending and disposable income are to be found. My advice is Act Now! Don\u2019t Delay! Support the environment, equality, and everything else good and right about America Before Midnight Tonight! Anything you can do to forward this email or Facebook post along to anyone who might find value in it or needs the encouragement to do what they know is right would be greatly appreciated. And remember, two good-for-giving regularly $19.95 Grill with Love gifts ( for just $15 each gets you free regular shipping.

Since January 2018, over 30 items have been discussed in closed Council. The community has a right to open debate and transparency - especially when decisions have a financial impact. I support limiting the use of closed session and regular public reporting of the non-confidential details discussed in closed sessions. The following is an article that appeared in the September 11 edition of the Kingston Whig Standard and it outlines the problems with our current municipal government.  Closed Meetings Under Fire In Loyalist Township By Elliot Fergus  ODESSA \u2013 Loyalist Township is being asked to account for the number of times it has met in closed session. Citing \u201csecrecy and lack of transparency,\u201d Amherst Island resident Deborah Barrett filed an official complaint to the township and asked for an investigation of \u201csystemic violations of the use of closed sessions to conduct township business.\u201d In a letter to township council, Barrett expressed concern about issues related to the Amherst Island wind energy project and the sale of land at locations around the township. \u201cIt is generally impossible for the public to determine from the council agendas and minutes what matters were considered and what decisions were made in closed session,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cIt is also impossible to determine the nature and value of land acquisition and disposition and the parties to the transaction.\u201d According to records from the Loyalist Township, council met in closed session 34 times in 2017 and 2018. Barrett wrote that not enough general information about the township\u2019s closed meetings has been made public. \u201cIn 2018 to date, council met in closed session about a dozen times and considered about 30 items,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cItems were added to the closed session portion of meetings, even though the council agenda was approved as circulated. No minutes were published for the July 5, 2018, meeting of council when the only item was a closed session.\u201d The Ontario Municipal Act allows councils to go into closed session for about a dozen reasons to discuss, among other things, labour contract negotiations, land sales or purchases, legal matters, and personal matters about an identifiable individual. The Ontario Ombudsman recommends municipal councils err on the side of making meetings public. When a municipal council must go behind closed doors, the Ombudsman recommended that they make sure the public knows why the meeting is closed, that they limit the meeting\u2019s discussion to the confidential topic, that votes in the meeting are limited to procedural reasons or to provide appropriate direction to staff, that they maintain a record of the meeting, and that they provide a timely report about the results of the meeting. Last month, a closed meeting investigator\u2019s report showed Kingston city council violated the Municipal Act when it voted behind closed doors to pay $850,000 to buy a tract of land in the city\u2019s west end.", "fin_ctg": "This ad is about political values and governance", "targets": "Age: 18 and older\nMinAge: 18\nRegion: \"Ontario\""}, {"id": "23842936410700272", "title": "Reform Austin", "page": "https://www.facebook.com/ReformAustin/", "paid_for_by": "Reform Austin, Inc.

This week the curtain was finally pulled back on how deeply un-American the Republican Party has become. This week made clear the Republican Party\u2019s been hijacked by the one-two combo of unlimited political spending and foreign forces seeking to end the very concept of government of, by and for the people. From ...just the White House-released summary, the Ukraine scandal is a mandatory open and shut case for the impeachment, but it is also so much more.  From a distance it can be easy to see the forces behind what the Republican Party has become as attacking America\u2019s liberal traditions, but it isn\u2019t that at all. Just the opposite really. Look around; more so than in decades, America\u2019s liberalism is fruitful and multiplying. Penzeys recently got the trademark for \u201cSeason Liberally.\u201d As trademarks go it\u2019s probably a pretty valuable one. Truth be told, what the Republican Party has become is entirely an attack on our country\u2019s conservative values. Look at this president; what is conservative about him? Nothing. Nothing at all. And it\u2019s his party now. The reality is the Republican Party has turned its back on conservative values and has instead come to embrace the \u201ctextbook\u201d racism of white nationalism. For the world\u2019s greatest military power to embrace nationalism is scary-dangerous. I\u2019ve always seen our mission as promoting and protecting the kindness found at the heart of cooking. It\u2019s cost us, but I don\u2019t see any way of us being us without standing up to the cruelty the Republican Party is now promoting. The spice business, at its best, can be a gateway to the world of beauty that diversity has created all around us. I want us to be the spice business at its best.  In this moment, we live at the heart of the struggle to defend American values both liberal and conservative. We don\u2019t know what is coming next or even how we got here. Over the decades, one of the things I\u2019ve come to admire most about Cooks is that they don\u2019t need certainties in order to do what is right, they find those in need and take care of them. Still, at some point future historians will have to come up with a consensus of how the values of the Republican Party were rewritten. My take is that it is the propaganda of the media of the right that will take the blame. We have our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails where we try to constantly find new ways to share the goodness at the heart of cooking. You should sign up here:  \u201cI was going to order some spices but I will not order ever from you. There are millions of people who believe in the ideals of the Republican Party. These ideals are smaller government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, strong national defense, and free markets. They believe the role of government is to give people the freedom to pursue these goals. You can believe what you want and express those views, just as I have the right to not buy anything from you and the right to tell my friends your prejudice against Conservatives and Republicans.\u201d Carolyn E.  The reality is, the past two years saw republicans holding the White House and both houses of Congress doing the exact opposite of all the things she sees herself as supporting them for. Under republican control, government grew larger than ever before, women\u2019s and minority rights were cut back, debts skyrocketed as we stopped paying our bills, our military\u2019s leadership was undermined as were our allies and NATO, plus as I can tell you personally as a company that brings you the best the world has to offer, tariffs have gone through the roof. Free trade? Good grief.  As a spice business we interact with customers from every possible walk of life. It\u2019s also our job to travel all those less-beaten paths of the world that the spice trade lives along. I\u2019ve found in every new shared experience, in every interaction, there is the chance for change. Whenever you ask yourself why would someone do that, spend some time with them and find out. Maybe you will end up doing that, too. But sometimes as humans we can be the victims of propaganda, sometimes we\u2019ve been intentionally taught to believe in what is not true. This is never easy to overcome, but we must try.  So many of us have loved ones who have fallen into supporting what the Republican Party has become in spite of their living lives radiating the decency their party now attacks. Truth is, there\u2019s little hope in trying to counter a belief that is 180 degrees at odds with facts. That belief is there because of propaganda, and as long as that propaganda is broadcast, that belief will be nearly impossible to shake. This is why in the events of this past week there is so much to be so very excited for.  You may not have been paying much attention this week, but the short version is the end is very near for this terrible turn the Republican Party has taken. The president\u2019s Ukraine scandal is the big one. I get that it can be hard to believe any scandal will stick, but this one is different. This one is going to show you, from its very beginning, our nation has been built up from its bedrock to be ready for any political party that would crown their leader king. America is something special. Looks like now everybody\u2019s going to have a front row seat for seeing why. The Mueller report was the FBI presenting a case they hoped would give the ten impeachable charges of obstruction they found a fair trial. With that report we discovered that it was not just the president who is guilty of obstruction but the members of his party as well. With the Ukraine charges this is so much more than the FBI asking for a fair trial. This is all the checks and balances of those who were there at America\u2019s founding, and knew the tyranny of living under kings, coming home to roost.  It\u2019s been little more than a week since we first heard of the whistleblower complaint and already the rising wave has engulfed not only the President, but the Vice President, Attorney General and the Secretary of State as well. This is just getting started. While the Republican Party believed itself in the free and clear, it seems those whose jobs it is to protect this country have been on the job all along. Sure seems everything the party has become since Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 election has been carefully lined up like dominoes. With the release of the whistleblower complaint the first domino got pushed. Whoosh! Boats start by sinking slowly, then sink fast. Those on the inside of the party and its media know the main hatchway\u2019s caved in. As the dominoes fall, America will soon be asking why on earth should we buy any product from any company that gives even one cent towards keeping Fox on the air? This is moving quickly. Already Fox is hedging. Already Drudge is asking where\u2019s the beef the president\u2019s promised economic growth? Now\u2019s not yet the time for counting chickens, but cautious optimism is definitely warranted. Without its propaganda the Republican Party we have come to know is done. Without that propaganda machine we get our loved ones back and that\u2019s worth celebrating. Hooray!  For conservatives, this is your time, too. Haven\u2019t you grown tired of the burden of being with the bad guys on every issue? There is absolutely no reason conservatives can\u2019t be on the good guys\u2019 side when it comes to racism, health care, refugees, affordable accessible birth control, gender equality, and pretty much every pressing issue of today. Conservation was virtually named after you. The forces that twisted conservative values into opposing conservation lost big this week. This is a Victory for every living thing on this planet. Seriously, REJOICE!!! Our nation\u2019s enemies didn\u2019t co-opt the Republican Party for no reason. America and its voice FOR ever-growing freedom and AGAINST the rule of dictators matters. The work to unravel the corruption that\u2019s taken hold of republican-held branches of government won\u2019t be easy. If liberals have to fix this on their own, they can and will, but it would be awesome to have conservatives pitching in alongside. You guys are hard workers, plus you always bring those cakes we like. It\u2019s time for you conservatives to get off the sidelines and back into the game. Now is the chance to take back your values. The opening is right there in front of you. Please get to it. We have your backs. Please pass this message along to all that see the value in America or who, with the right encouragement, might have the chance to. And if the opportunity arises, hug a whistleblower. They are keeping all that is good about America alive.

In the meantime, the project is halted until voters decide how San Diego should grow in the future. #noonnewlandsierra #noonnewland #newland #newlandsierra", "fin_ctg": "Election", "targets": "Age: 18 and older\nMinAge: 18\nRegion: California\nLike\""}, {"id": "23843967872890308", "title": "Bernie Sanders", "page": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/", "paid_for_by": "Bernie 2020.", "categories_1": "Political Candidate", "fr": 1.0, "label": "str_p", "text": "It is outrageous that you can get arrested for smoking marijuana, but not one of the crooks on Wall Street went to jail for nearly destroying the economy 11 years ago.

Until then, you can still be one of America\u2019s good guys. Not comfortable with his latest race-based immigration fears? Don\u2019t let history lump you in with the white hoods and robes crowd. History has its eyes on all of us, and history remembers. An...d keep in mind, history doesn\u2019t play fair. Where we have only some of the information, by the time the history of this time gets told, history will have all the details and more. History will have the Mueller Report in its full, un-redacted sweetness. History will know every step along the way from his campaign\u2019s first contact with the Russian spies right up to him freely quoting the stolen emails on the campaign stage. History will even have his tax returns. How is that even fair? But as much as history will have all the info, at this point we really aren\u2019t missing that much. Does each and every dot along the way need to be fully penciled in before we admit the obvious line between that first meeting and the knowing use of Russian-hacked documents on the campaign trail? At this point does anyone think he is keeping his tax returns hidden out of a sense of humility? In time, every detail will be documented, but right here, right now, we are already well past the reasonable doubt stage. The Right Side of History Train is blowing its final boarding call whistle. ALL-A-BOARD!!! And despite the purposefully crafted fears to the otherwise, no hate here. We really are ready to welcome in all late comers with kindness and appreciation. And did I mention we have cookies? (See recipe below). That this train exists at all, much less that it is already rolling under a full head of steam, is something incredibly worth celebrating. Everybody in this country owes a debt to all those who gave so much of themselves for these past two years to keep alive the hope that is at the heart of the American Spirit. From the very first full day in office with The Women\u2019s March, to those who will spend Monday knocking on doors to Get Out The Vote, there are so many owed so much thanks.  So until the end of day Saturday 11.3.18 we are offering a $28.95 value Hope and Kindness Gift Box that has our Embrace Hope pin, Kind pin, Heal the World Bumper/Refrigerator magnet, and half-cup jar of our really tasty Roasted Garlic all packed into a happy little yellow Penzeys box. These are nice. To get your in-store coupon for the Hope and Kindness Penzeys box just click this link:   Online at penzeys.com, just spend at least $5 and then enter \u201cKind\u201d in the apply code box at checkout. Don\u2019t place the box into your basket, the code will do that for you and for free. It\u2019s easy, though sorry, standard shipping charges apply. If you are looking for a good choice to meet the $5 minimum, can I recommend our Penzeys Pepper? It really is the world\u2019s best Pepper, and for each jar sold we give an equally fresh jar to those who feed those in need.

The same forces of unlimited political spending that brought all this to the nation in 2016 first started a trial version in our home state of Wisconsin in 2010. We were targeted for our outstanding public schools and universities and also for our leadership in environmental protection. What they\u2019ve done hasn\u2019t been pretty, but along the way we\u2019ve learned a few things.  Here is Wisconsin it began with what\u2019s best described as a blitzkrieg attack on our state\u2019s teachers. It was well planned, well funded, and it was all about breaking the teachers\u2019 spirits. For a while it worked. The inhumanity of using their media to turn teachers into villains in the eyes of the people of Wisconsin simply to reward the governor\u2019s benefactors with tax cuts was too much for us. The center of the attack was the state\u2019s largest school district here in Milwaukee. The first inservice day of back to school that fall we had a newly-created Teach! Gift box on every teacher\u2019s and support staff\u2019s desk. 9,600+ in total. In it, along with two Spices, were a Teachers Care bumper sticker, a Teach! pin, and a 24-page Teach! mini cook booklet. Somehow it helped. I\u2019ve had MPS teachers tell me it had gotten to the point where they did not want to go out in public for fear of being asked what they did for a living with all the right wing hate being directed at them. AM radio talkers really are like cancer to everything good in our area. And as much as this opened our eyes to the power of pins, and as good as the Spices were, and I still see the original Teachers Care bumper stickers, ultimately it was the booklet that turned the tide. In the face of the inhumanity being directed at the teachers, by simply showing the humanity of teachers and their kindness, the bubble of hate towards them burst. It was an eye-opener.  So we were ready for the Women\u2019s March January 21, 2017. I don\u2019t know if any of us understand just how much every American owes to those who participated in the Women\u2019s March. All the damage done here in Wisconsin, everything we are still trying to dig out from, was accomplished because they had us convinced they were popular and had the will of the people. The outpouring of humanity that was the Women\u2019s March dwarfed the inauguration crowds the previous day. He lied so hard about that because he needed it to set in motion all he wanted to do. But the myth of popular support never left the ground. The history books should teach 1.21.17 like D-Day 6.6.44. It\u2019s that important.  So it\u2019s two years later, and thanks to everyone who marched on January 21 and everyone who\u2019s pitched in since, Hope is still alive, and that\u2019s a reason to celebrate. Stop into our store for your Hope and Kindness Box. And if you haven\u2019t already, jump on the Right Side of History Train before it leaves this coming Tuesday. Vote Vote Vote! Oh yeah, Cookies!

But this is about more than that. Much more. To get your $30.44 value flat-out Free in store coupon click here:   The upcoming 11.6.18 election has all the makings to be the greatest election of our lives, but at this moment far too many of us are acting like we expect it to be the worst. We have to change this, and we have to change this now. Yes, Republican leadership in the Senate pushing through someone with a clear lifetime anger towards women to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court was heartbreaking. But that\u2019s exactly why they did it, to break our hearts, diminish our spirits, and leave us hopeless about this election. We can\u2019t give them that satisfaction, not now, not when so much is at stake.  We\u2019ve waited and watched for nearly two years as the Republican Party did its best to disassemble all that has made America a leader among nations and the values we hold dear. Now is the time to say no to those who would take health care from families in need, promote fear of minorities and coldly turn away refugees, sell off our environment to whoever offers the largest campaign donation, and to the party that voted to give anger towards women a lifetime appointment to America\u2019s Supreme Court. The science shows that as a Cook you have the power to shape better futures for all those around you. Now is no time for you to be on the sideline. We need you back in the game. I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s not much of a better way to get you out of your intentionally induced Republican funk than getting you in a Penzeys store right now, if only to stand in a line just long enough to get you to see that as a Cook you really are a part of something so much bigger than just your own experience. So I\u2019m asking you if at all possible to please come in and take us up on our free offer. You know I\u2019ve been there for you these last couple years. Now I\u2019m asking you to be there for me, and for the rest of the Cooks in your shared community. I wouldn\u2019t be asking if it wasn\u2019t important. If you are down and out, we need you up and in. If you are not at all down but already honestly excited for what this election is about to bring, we need you in even more. Your optimism is exactly what we are looking to share.  To get your flat-out free $19.95 value \"I Will Vote\" Kind Box and your up to $10.49 value half-cup jar of your choice, just click this link to get your in store coupon and bring it to one of our stores before the end of day Sunday 10.21.18.

Just remember to send them to this link first to get their in store coupon:  And thanks for voting and for sharing the importance of this coming election with all those around you. Cooks go through stages. Early on, the fact that the people you cook for appreciate/admire/like you is a big part of why it\u2019s good to be a Cook. As time passes I\u2019ve found that the applause piece fades in value and is replaced by the simple joy that comes from having the ability to make others happy.  But as a Cook you really are admired, and that\u2019s what makes you such a valuable spokesperson when it comes to going the final distance to have others see the light and finally embrace the value in getting out to vote. Plus, no one is going to bite the hand that feeds them. In these next couple of weeks, do all you can to reach all you can about just how important it is to vote in this election. You have the ability to make a big difference here; please use it. This really matters. To Cook is to Care. To Care is to Vote. And right now, this country needs the kindness of Cooks in a big way. Thanks to you and your kindness there is very real hope that 11.6.18 will be the day we take the first big step toward restoring America back to being America again. Vote and make everyone you know vote, too. And get to one of our stores or at least visit us at penzeys.com. This really is an offer you need to be a part of. Please participate in this one, if just as a favor for me. This one matters. Thanks.  And thanks for having the kindness to be you, Bill Penzey bill@penzeys.com And please remember, liking this post, liking our FB page, and even more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our \u201cpolitical\u201d belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people. And sharing $30.44 worth of flat-out free, really good Spices while at the same time reminding everyone of the value in voting and the hope this election holds is well worth sharing. Please share this one with everyone.

It\u2019s a hot topic when you\u2019re getting ready to join Medicare...AND, it\u2019s important to know the benefits of each so you can make an informed decision.  In this post (and video), I\u2019m sharing an email lesson, about this topic, from my FREE Medicare eCourse that nearly 1,000 people have benefited from. To receive the entire eCourse, sign up at www.remedigap.com/ecourse I hope you find it valuable.  Generally, I'm the kind of person that can see both sides of an argument. But, when it comes to Medicare Advantage Plans... compared to Medigap, I definitely pick sides. I'm all in when it comes to Medigap. I understand Medicare Advantage is a necessary product for some, but it would not be my first choice. Here begins my rant... Sorry to be so abrupt, but I have had some bad experiences with Medicare Advantage plans.  The most recent experience was when my mom and thousands of other beneficiaries were blindsided when their Medicare Advantage Plan went bankrupt. It was a massive shuffle. They all had to go back on original Medicare and were susceptible to the 20% costs not covered by Part A and Part B.  They had to wait 30 days to get a Medigap plan or another Medicare Advantage Plan in place. Talk about stressful. This doesn't happen often, but it was the last straw for me. I know a HUGE draw to Medicare Advantage plans is the lower premium. Lower premiums are nice, but it also means less coverage. Do you think an insurance company is going to sell a plan that has MORE benefits for LESS money? The Advantage plans typically offered cap your out of pocket expenses, but the upper limit can be as high as $6,700.  PLUS your Rx expenses -- PLUS out of network charges -- PLUS unapproved charges. Have a bad year and you can pay a ton for that supposedly inexpensive Advantage Plan. AND, that $6,700 will reset at the beginning of the year! Most Medicare Advantage Plans include prescription drug coverage.  However, Advantage plans actually cover fewer drugs at a higher copay than if you purchase a Part D drug plan separately. Some large companies market their Medicare plans quite heavily and they're very popular. But the drug plan that is included in your Advantage plan may not include all your medications. Or may be covered at a higher tier level...meaning higher costs to you. As a reminder, Medicare Advantage is known as Medicare Part C. It combines Part A, Part B, and usually Part D.   Medicare Advantage Plans come in the shape of HMOs and PPOs. Medicare Advantage HMOs and PPOs have limited networks. Even the larger companies struggle with consistently keeping providers from dropping out of network. Just because you saw your doctor's name in the provider book when you enrolled doesn't mean they'll be in network for the life of your plan. Medicare Advantage plan networks are usually regional. That means you have to visit a provider within your specified area -- otherwise, it's considered out of network. This is hard for people who live in rural areas or anyone who visits providers in a neighboring county, city, or state. A recent analysis of Medicare Advantage plans by Kaiser Family Foundation found that, on average, only half of area hospitals are included in-network. And...one in five Medicare Advantage plans have no Academic Medical Center in-network. AND...More than two in five Medicare Advantage Plans do not include a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in their network. So, how is Medigap better than Medicare Advantage? Medigap plans use the same network as Medicare. And, Medicare has a vast provider network. Medigap users can visit any Medicare hospital or provider anywhere in the United States without a referral. You don't have to worry about a Medical Director reviewing and denying your claim. If Medicare approves your claim, your Medigap company will pay its portion. They're required by law! Yes, there is a premium. Yes, it may be more than a Medicare Advantage Plan. But, can you put a price on peace of mind?

Professors Alicia Uribe and Brain Gaines, from University of Illinois Department of Political Sciencei, are experts in the scientific study of federal courts, bureaucracies, and elections, and their diverse expertise will help us understand ongoing debates about federal investigators and courts, presidential power, and accountability for wrongdoing.

Let me take time to explain my stance. It is not that I won\u2019t allow our deputies to wear body cameras.  The fact is, I have to be a good steward of the tax payers dollars.  Agencies are shelving their body cameras due to cost, privacy issues and reliability. Just recently, NYPD just recalled 3000 body cameras because one caught on fire. Until studies prove that crime is reduced because of body cameras being worn,... I may consider. The fact is, citizens of Bernalillo County are fed up with crime and fed up with being victimized. I have priorities for the Bernalillo County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The citizens of our great county deserve well trained and equipped deputies to respond to their needs. I have deputies that do not have radio coverage in the east mountains. That is a very concerning issue for me. I need a much needed raise for our deputies, who go out and risk their lives every single day. I have deputies that are driving patrol cars that have over 120k miles and I question their road worthiness. I would like more deputies so I could place in every elementary school, in order to keep our children safe.  It is a budget issue and if the county has available funding, I would focus on our priorities first. In addition, I support dash cameras and have started implementing them within certain units. Body cameras have been sold as a silver-bullet solution, a newfangled quick fix to cure policing of its public trust deficit. Instead, our deputy behaviors will continue to be shaped most by recruitment, selection and the training they receive.

Our second ever Penzeys contest! The rules are pretty simple. We promise to open a store in whatever community in the US with a metro population of 350,000 or more that gets the most people to sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list By March 31, 2019. To sign up, just click this link:  If you are in a smaller community, or already have a Penzeys in your town, you can still vote for where you would like to see our next store by clicking on any one of the 106 possible locations. Yes, this also means you can encourage everyone you know from around the country to sign up and vote for your town. Our stores really do have an amazing way of setting both tasty meals and better futures in motion. Wherever we open, good things follow. That\u2019s not so much us, that\u2019s you. There is an amazing power to the kindness of Cooks; to be where they gather never fails to brighten even the gloomiest of days. And in these times where some are trying to push the politics of fear, our stores are a great reminder that real strength comes not from driving others away, but from gathering everyone around the table. Cooks Heal the World, and a big part of that is by creating a community of caring that really does make a difference. Help us celebrate the kindness of cooking in your town. And rest assured, as much as this is a contest, and as much as we do promise to deliver a Penzeys Store to whatever area has the most signups, we are still Penzeys. We are not doing this to punish the second place finisher or even the sixth. We want to know where we are wanted, but at the same time we also want to be where we are needed. Your words mean a great deal to us. In the comments below please feel free to put in a pitch for a community that may not get the numbers to win, but would still be the right spot for us to be. We promise to be open to what you write. Together we can make the world a better place by spreading the incredible value in caring for each other one store at a time. Please share this with friends and family and encourage them to do the same. And remember, to make your vote official you need to open the confirmation email we send right after you sign up. Unlike some, we want every vote counted :) Once again, here\u2019s that link. Don\u2019t put this off, click now:  Thanks!

This week the curtain was finally pulled back on how deeply un-American the Republican Party has become. This week made clear the Republican Party\u2019s been hijacked by the one-two combo of unlimited political spending and foreign forces seeking to end the very concept of government of, by and for the people. From ...just the White House-released summary, the Ukraine scandal is a mandatory open and shut case for the impeachment, but it is also so much more.  From a distance it can be easy to see the forces behind what the Republican Party has become as attacking America\u2019s liberal traditions, but it isn\u2019t that at all. Just the opposite really. Look around; more so than in decades, America\u2019s liberalism is fruitful and multiplying. Penzeys recently got the trademark for \u201cSeason Liberally.\u201d As trademarks go it\u2019s probably a pretty valuable one. Truth be told, what the Republican Party has become is entirely an attack on our country\u2019s conservative values. Look at this president; what is conservative about him? Nothing. Nothing at all. And it\u2019s his party now. The reality is the Republican Party has turned its back on conservative values and has instead come to embrace the \u201ctextbook\u201d racism of white nationalism. For the world\u2019s greatest military power to embrace nationalism is scary-dangerous. I\u2019ve always seen our mission as promoting and protecting the kindness found at the heart of cooking. It\u2019s cost us, but I don\u2019t see any way of us being us without standing up to the cruelty the Republican Party is now promoting. The spice business, at its best, can be a gateway to the world of beauty that diversity has created all around us. I want us to be the spice business at its best.  In this moment, we live at the heart of the struggle to defend American values both liberal and conservative. We don\u2019t know what is coming next or even how we got here. Over the decades, one of the things I\u2019ve come to admire most about Cooks is that they don\u2019t need certainties in order to do what is right, they find those in need and take care of them. Still, at some point future historians will have to come up with a consensus of how the values of the Republican Party were rewritten. My take is that it is the propaganda of the media of the right that will take the blame. We have our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking emails where we try to constantly find new ways to share the goodness at the heart of cooking. You should sign up here:   Part of that voice is standing up to the cruelty to those less privileged that the Republican Party has come to embrace. This means customers leaving us and oftentimes sending me emails explaining why. Here\u2019s a recent one that sums up so well the effect of the propaganda republican voters live within: \u201cI was going to order some spices but I will not order ever from you. There are millions of people who believe in the ideals of the Republican Party. These ideals are smaller government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, strong national defense, and free markets. They believe the role of government is to give people the freedom to pursue these goals. You can believe what you want and express those views, just as I have the right to not buy anything from you and the right to tell my friends your prejudice against Conservatives and Republicans.\u201d Carolyn E.  The reality is, the past two years saw republicans holding the White House and both houses of Congress doing the exact opposite of all the things she sees herself as supporting them for. Under republican control, government grew larger than ever before, women\u2019s and minority rights were cut back, debts skyrocketed as we stopped paying our bills, our military\u2019s leadership was undermined as were our allies and NATO, plus as I can tell you personally as a company that brings you the best the world has to offer, tariffs have gone through the roof. Free trade? Good grief.  As a spice business we interact with customers from every possible walk of life. It\u2019s also our job to travel all those less-beaten paths of the world that the spice trade lives along. I\u2019ve found in every new shared experience, in every interaction, there is the chance for change. Whenever you ask yourself why would someone do that, spend some time with them and find out. Maybe you will end up doing that, too. But sometimes as humans we can be the victims of propaganda, sometimes we\u2019ve been intentionally taught to believe in what is not true. This is never easy to overcome, but we must try.  So many of us have loved ones who have fallen into supporting what the Republican Party has become in spite of their living lives radiating the decency their party now attacks. Truth is, there\u2019s little hope in trying to counter a belief that is 180 degrees at odds with facts. That belief is there because of propaganda, and as long as that propaganda is broadcast, that belief will be nearly impossible to shake. This is why in the events of this past week there is so much to be so very excited for.  You may not have been paying much attention this week, but the short version is the end is very near for this terrible turn the Republican Party has taken. The president\u2019s Ukraine scandal is the big one. I get that it can be hard to believe any scandal will stick, but this one is different. This one is going to show you, from its very beginning, our nation has been built up from its bedrock to be ready for any political party that would crown their leader king. America is something special. Looks like now everybody\u2019s going to have a front row seat for seeing why. The Mueller report was the FBI presenting a case they hoped would give the ten impeachable charges of obstruction they found a fair trial. With that report we discovered that it was not just the president who is guilty of obstruction but the members of his party as well. With the Ukraine charges this is so much more than the FBI asking for a fair trial. This is all the checks and balances of those who were there at America\u2019s founding, and knew the tyranny of living under kings, coming home to roost.  It\u2019s been little more than a week since we first heard of the whistleblower complaint and already the rising wave has engulfed not only the President, but the Vice President, Attorney General and the Secretary of State as well. This is just getting started. While the Republican Party believed itself in the free and clear, it seems those whose jobs it is to protect this country have been on the job all along. Sure seems everything the party has become since Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 election has been carefully lined up like dominoes. With the release of the whistleblower complaint the first domino got pushed. Whoosh! Boats start by sinking slowly, then sink fast. Those on the inside of the party and its media know the main hatchway\u2019s caved in. As the dominoes fall, America will soon be asking why on earth should we buy any product from any company that gives even one cent towards keeping Fox on the air? This is moving quickly. Already Fox is hedging. Already Drudge is asking where\u2019s the beef the president\u2019s promised economic growth? Now\u2019s not yet the time for counting chickens, but cautious optimism is definitely warranted. Without its propaganda the Republican Party we have come to know is done. Without that propaganda machine we get our loved ones back and that\u2019s worth celebrating. Hooray!  For conservatives, this is your time, too. Haven\u2019t you grown tired of the burden of being with the bad guys on every issue? There is absolutely no reason conservatives can\u2019t be on the good guys\u2019 side when it comes to racism, health care, refugees, affordable accessible birth control, gender equality, and pretty much every pressing issue of today. Conservation was virtually named after you. The forces that twisted conservative values into opposing conservation lost big this week. This is a Victory for every living thing on this planet. Seriously, REJOICE!!! Our nation\u2019s enemies didn\u2019t co-opt the Republican Party for no reason. America and its voice FOR ever-growing freedom and AGAINST the rule of dictators matters. The work to unravel the corruption that\u2019s taken hold of republican-held branches of government won\u2019t be easy. If liberals have to fix this on their own, they can and will, but it would be awesome to have conservatives pitching in alongside. You guys are hard workers, plus you always bring those cakes we like. It\u2019s time for you conservatives to get off the sidelines and back into the game. Now is the chance to take back your values. The opening is right there in front of you. Please get to it. We have your backs. Please pass this message along to all that see the value in America or who, with the right encouragement, might have the chance to. And if the opportunity arises, hug a whistleblower. They are keeping all that is good about America alive.

Efforts are also currently underway to increase the number of Republican women in Congress. Check out gopwomenforprogress.org and their upcoming workshop on political campaigning with the Women's Campaign... School at Yale here:   Margaret Madeline Chase Smith (December 14, 1897 \u2013 May 29, 1995) was a member of the Republican Party and served as a U.S Representative (1940-1949) and a U.S. Senator (1949-1973) from Maine. She was the first woman to serve in both houses of the United States Congress. Smith is best remembered for her 1950 speech, \u201cDeclaration of Conscience,\u201d in which she criticized the tactics of McCarthyism.  Smith earned a reputation as a moderate Republican who often broke ranks with her party. For example, she supported much of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal legislation. Congresswoman Smith was also a strong supporter of women in the armed services. Smith was sworn into the Senate on January 3, 1949. After less than a year in office, she gained national attention when she became the first member of Congress to condemn the anti-Communist witch hunt led by her fellow Republican Senator, Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. In a well-publicized speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, four months earlier, McCarthy claimed to possess the names of 205 card-carrying Communists in the State Department. Smith, like many of her colleagues, shared McCarthy\u2019s concerns about Communist subversion, but she grew skeptical when McCarthy repeatedly ignored her requests for evidence to back up his accusations. On June 1, 1950, Smith delivered a fifteen-minute speech on the Senate floor, known as the \u201cDeclaration of Conscience,\u201d in which she refused to name McCarthy directly (bowing to Senate rules on comity) but denounced \u201cthe reckless abandon in which unproved charges have been hurled from this side of the aisle.\u201d She said McCarthyism had \u201cdebased\u201d the Senate to \u201cthe level of a forum of hate and character assassination.\u201d While acknowledging her desire for Republicans\u2019 political success, Smith said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the four horseman of calumny \u2014 fear, ignorance, bigotry, and smear.\u201d Six other moderate Senate Republicans signed onto her Declaration, including Wayne Morse of Oregon, George Aiken of Vermont, Edward Thye of Minnesota, Irving Ives of New York, Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, and Robert C. Hendrickson of New Jersey.  Smith\u2019s speech triggered a public explosion of support and criticism. \u201cThis cool breeze of honesty from Maine can blow the whole miasma out of the nation\u2019s soul,\u201d stated the Hartford Courant. \u201cBy one act of political courage, [Smith has] justified a lifetime in politics,\u201d commented another. Newsweek magazine ran a cover story entitled \u201cSenator Smith: A Woman Vice President?\u201d But critics called her \u201cMoscow-loving,\u201d and much worse. McCarthy dismissed her and her supporters as \u201cSnow White and the Six Dwarfs.\u201d  In the 1952 election, Smith was widely mentioned as a Vice-Presidential candidate to run with General Dwight D. Eisenhower. When asked by a reporter what she would do if she woke up one morning and found herself in the White House, she replied: \u201cI\u2019d go straight to Mrs. Truman and apologize. Then I\u2019d go home.\u201d  Smith was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination in the 1964 presidential election.  Nonetheless she was the first woman to be placed in nomination for the United States Presidency at a major Party\u2019s convention. Upon leaving office, she was the longest-serving female Senator in history. Smith was the first (and as yet only) woman to serve as chair of the Senate Republican Conference, serving from 1967 to 1972. She voted against President Nixon\u2019s unsuccessful nominees to the Supreme Court, Clement Haynsworth in 1969 and G. Harrold Carswell in 1970.  Smith was a strong supporter of the space program. NASA administrator James E. Webb once commented that the United States never would have placed a man on the Moon if it were not for Smith. She also supported increased educational funding, civil rights, and Medicare. Recently retired Republican Maine Senator Olympia Snowe was asked what Senator Smith would think of today\u2019s Republican Party. Snowe responded, \u201cOh my gosh! She\u2019d be appalled. I don\u2019t think she could conceive of how it\u2019s all evolved today. Even in my own experience, it\u2019s hard to comprehend.\u201d Listen to Senator Susan Collins\u2019s tribute to Senator Smith to learn more about her life here:", "fin_ctg": "Political figure", "targets": "Age: 18 and older\nMinAge: 18\nInterest: Higher education\nRegion: \"the United States\""}, {"id": "23843166737600778", "title": "Kitsap Humane Society", "page": "https://www.facebook.com/KitsapHumaneSociety/", "paid_for_by": "this is empty", "categories_1": "Animal Shelter", "fr": 0.1818181818, "label": "np", "text": "Enzo ; Ranger are a perfect match, and we have a match for you!

The opinions are those of the writer. SFERS V. CCSF (PRE-1996) Notice received on 7/27/2018: \u201cBy the order of the Supreme Court, the case has been transferred from Division Four Appellate Court to Division One Appellate Court.\u201d (Our understanding is that the transfer was due to retirements in the Division Four Court.) Health Service System Concerns have been raised by United Health Care members regarding skilled nursing care facilities in San Francisco\u2014or lack thereof. POB believes that retirees should have access to the best health affordable health care, and urges HSS to make every effort to increase the number of skilled nursing care facilities available to our members. SFERS Retirement Board As of 6/30/18, the SFERS Retirement Fund was valued at $24.4 billion\u2014up roughly $2 billion for the fiscal year\u2014and paid out $1.5 billion to retirees. For the fiscal year 2017/18 SFERS fund was up 11.3%, which will likely be upgraded to 11.4% or 11.5% after the actuarial report is completed. These numbers bode well for the approval of a supplemental COLA. July 1, 2018 was the start of our new fiscal year. For the month of July SFERS fund had gained 1.02%. Protect Our Benefits Good news! POB is officially a tax-deductible educational charitable trust. \u201cThank you\u201d for your patience, and bearing with us.

V-pin/Hot Chocolate/Thyme/Cajun free w $5 spend So WWII, a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party\u2019s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There\u2019s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it\u2019s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington\u2019s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing. Plus $19.95 Kind Heart Boxes for just $12.50. To see Bicentennial Rub for turkey click this link:  For Rubbed Sage please click here:  To see the cheerful Kind Hart Box please click on this link:  Plus, we are on the verge of the holiday season, so we are doing our best to entice you in with a free $4.29 Penzeys Hot Chocolate and $4.28 combined value French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning. And where sometimes it\u2019s your choice of the offers with $5, both with $10, this time a single $5 in spending gets you both offers and the very cool new V pin as well. With all this going on now\u2019s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com Sadly, Saturday won\u2019t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren\u2019t the draw, it\u2019s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin. In our stores or online there is no coupon or code needed for the free with purchase V pin, $1 Bicentennial and Rubbed Sage and the good deal on the Kind Heart Boxes. All those are automatic for everyone.  To get your in store coupons good for the free with $5 purchase $8.57 combined value Hot Chocolate French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning, please click this link:  Online at penzeys.com While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that\u2019s been allowed to be directed towards America\u2019s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here:  And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday\u2019s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There\u2019s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won\u2019t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times. Thank you for your support, Bill bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our \u201cpolitical\u201d belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people.

In the Presidential Proclamation which Trump has drafted, it allegedly states that \"The massive amount of aliens who unlawfully enter the United Stat...es each day is a direct threat to the safety and security of our nation and constitutes a national emergency.\" The proclamation would also direct the deployment of the US Army Corps of Engineers to construct the wall, some of which would be built on private property that would require the government to seize the land from individual homeowners for the construction of the project. The President would obtain the funds by pulling $3.6 billion which is available for military development, $3 billion from the Pentagon Civil Works Fund, $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security, and an additional $681 million from Treasury Forfeiture Funds. He would in total reprogram approximately $7 billion in funds which are currently appropriated or dedicated for other purposes.  If Trump takes this action, then it will undoubtedly be litigated in the courts. However, if his actions are upheld, then it would establish a dangerous legal precedent which future presidents may take to bypass Congress. This is an issue which profoundly disturbs many Democratic and Republican members of both the US Senate and House Representatives due to its unprecedented nature. If Trump was genuinely concerned about terrorism and national security, then he'd also be advocating for the construction of a wall along our border with Canada which is severalfold greater in distance than our border with Mexico.", "fin_ctg": "This ad is about political values and governance", "targets": "Age: 18 and older\nMinAge: 18\nCity: Greer\nState: \"South Carolina\""}, {"id": "23842999064800787", "title": "The Young Turks", "page": "https://www.facebook.com/TheYoungTurks/", "paid_for_by": "TYT Network", "categories_1": "TV Show", "fr": 0.3333333333, "label": "np", "text": "Join the progressive movement.

Transit access to jobs, education, healthcare and many other destinations for thousands of members of our community, is being threatened of falling deeper into a death spiral: an endless cycle of ser...vice cuts, fare increases and ridership decline. A new vision is needed. In 2006, a single trip on RTA cost only $1.25- since then, fares have Doubled while service has been cut over 25%. A study at McGill University has shown that the amount transit service provided and fares charged impact ridership much more than the gas prices or the availability of rideshare services. Ongoing service cuts and fare hikes have reduced ridership to a record low. We cannot afford to wait on the state. RTA is facing the loss of over $20 million per year due to state officials in Columbus, who have cut state transit funding over 80% in the last two decades- lower than Alaska, Vermont, or Iowa spend on public transportation. The State of Ohio has failed to support our communities and the need to connect workers and families to jobs and opportunities.

More than two dozen mangled and rotting Asian elephant corpses lay rotting in a riverbed in the Ayeyawady (Irrawaddy) delta in southwestern Myanmar. The skin of these highly intelligent and emotionally sensitive animals had been flayed from their bones, apparently to sell in Asian markets as gruesome elephant skin jewelry and \"medicines\" that claim to cure whatever ails you. Only around 40,000-50,000 Asian elephants remained in the world in 2003, and scientists believe the population has been declining since.

Over the last one hundred years, it has grown and developed in a variety of ways; manifesting itself in the Charismatic movement, the Word of Faith perspective, Third Wave, and most recently, The New Apostolic Reformation.  With the appearance of each new branch from the Azusa tree, the departures from the historic Christian faith have become progressively more radical and extreme.  As a result, Evangelical Christianity is facing a spiritual crisis which must be confronted.   While it will not be the purpose of this analysis to question the validity of anyone\u2019s conversion experience (2 Timothy 2:19), this study is designed to reveal how flawed the teachings of Charismania truly are; as it pertains to the Christian life and its practice.  I am confident that it will provide encouragement to Christians who have been told they are second class citizens in the kingdom of God, simply because they have refused to participate in this movement.  Hopefully, it will furnish much needed reassurance to those who have left Charismania behind, in favor of a relationship with God based on sound doctrine.  Finally, if this critique serves as a call to repentance for those still ensnared by Pentecostal/Charismatic doctrine, it will have been well worth the effort.  \u201cThis is a scholarly, systematic and thoroughly researched topic of a doctrine that is widely embraced on a surface level.  Henry Igras has produced a masterpiece and is to be applauded for his courage and wisdom to speak out the truth in love, in his exegesis of the Scriptures.  He is truly one who is \u2018diligent to present himself approved of God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the Word of Truth.\u2019 (2 Timothy 2:15).  This is a must read for anyone whose ministry intersects with Charismatics and Pentecostals.\u201d Dr. John Matthew \u2013 30 years of Missionary Service with Christar \u201cMy experience in the Charismatic movement began soon after I became a Christian.  I accepted Christ as my Savior at a University of Florida golf team meeting (October 22, 1971), of all places.  It was an immature stage mostly of emotion and little Biblical doctrine; also coincidentally involved in the emotional realm of the Charismatic pattern of Christian living.  I can confidently say that only when I was under sound Biblical teaching, did I become grounded and established in the faith, moving away from erroneous influential emotions of the Charismatic movement.  This study by Henry Igras effectively addresses the error of those in the Charismatic movement; specifically, that of embracing passages of a \u2018historical narrative as a rule to be obeyed\u2019 in one\u2019s everyday Christian walk.  Scripture must be wholly supportive of any Christian way of life deemed to be normative.  The whole of Scripture must be understood in its context.  Henry Igras does this effectively in his treatise regarding Charismania by his detailing of all its flaws within the cloud of emotions.  The foundational phase of the church was critical, but now the structural phase delineates the \u2018descriptive\u2019 from the \u2018prescriptive\u2019 understanding of Scripture.  As Henry clearly states, \u2018. . . the epistles of the apostles provide the necessary norms for what would prove to be the structural phase of the building of Christ\u2019s Church.\u2019\u201d  Kevin Selkregg \u2013 Retired Manager:  Analytical and Testing Laboratory", "fin_ctg": "Not political", "targets": "Not Specified"}, {"id": "23843064478290529", "title": "Planned Parenthood Votes!

So much so dangerous to America hides behind the untruth that the Republican Party is no worse than the Democratic Party or that the problem isn\u2019t with what the Republican Party has become, but will end up when the current president is gone. Fifty years ago this would have been true, but it\u2019s not true now, and it hasn\u2019t been true for a really long time. In thes...e divided times. where can you look to see beyond the political \u201cmy side is better\u201d slogans that have been with us from our country\u2019s very beginning and see where the parties actually are? At Penzeys we believe it is time to look to Justice. As we move towards our nation\u2019s 250th birthday, it is good that we are now beginning to be honest about the inequality of America\u2019s birth. The late 1700s were a time of incredible inequality. But as much as our founders were clearly products of their day, it\u2019s also important to recognize that they were the ones who objected to that inequality. They risked absolutely everything to fight a revolution for liberty and equality and set in motion an ever more perfect union for We the People where Justice came first. Their revolution changed the world. For our founders it wasn\u2019t enough to give Congress equal power in their position of oversight of the presidency to ensure future kings would not emerge. They held justice so important that they created a third equal branch of government, the judiciary, whose sole role is the insurance of justice. They knew their new form of government, as one day Lincoln would so correctly call it\u2014\u201cby the people, of the people, for the people\u201d\u2014could only exist as long as we the people are protected from the injustice those seeking power for their own advantage always inflict. With our founders, like with anyone, hero worship isn\u2019t healthy. No child should ever have to look up to see someone on a pedestal who would enslave them. Still, credit where credit is due, the founding fathers\u2019 revolution changed the world for the better in a way only a very select few ever have. And for pretty much 200 years, thanks to the support and sacrifice of generation after generation of Americans to the ideals of that revolution of 1776, the founders delivered the ever more perfect union of ever-growing equality they dreamed of. But now the time has come for all who share in their dream to take notice, because their dream, our dream, is very much at risk. And I get how people who have been lifelong Republicans ever since your dad sat you down and explained the many reasons he liked president Ike Eisenhower can be thinking the current overwhelming distrust of republicans is way out of line. You have your Fox-inspired \u201cnews\u201d telling you that you are still supporting the good guys. But the thing is, you\u2019re not. And if you don\u2019t believe this, just look at who the Republican presidents have been nominating and Republican senators have been approving for the Supreme Court since the time of Bush Sr. There\u2019s no denying the trend here.  The thing about the Supreme Court is that it\u2019s always been a place much like Whoville on Christmas Day. Being exposed to the centuries of goodness set in motion by all those who wore that robe before you changes you. The court\u2019s history is ripe with judges with hearts two sizes too small suddenly becoming far more human than those who nominated them ever wanted them to be once they took their seat. The voices of Washington, Jefferson and even Alexander Hamilton are very much alive on that bench and the pressure they create is too much for the merely mildly mean-spirited to resist. To stand in the way of equality, to use all the privilege that comes with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court to hurt those most vulnerable takes a pretty damaged individual. Those responsible for these nominations know this. It takes a special sort to take the ownership of this country away from we the people and deliver it unto those funding the elections of Republican politicians.  Didn\u2019t you think it was odd that Republicans saw someone taking a paycheck as the leader of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission using their position to provide very unequal employment opportunities for women as a sign they belong on the Supreme Court? Or in this time when the rights of women are so much at risk, how could Republicans nominate someone with such obvious anger at women unless it was their goal all along to find someone who wouldn\u2019t flinch when the time came to take away the rights women have worked for generations to earn? Those doing the nominating weren\u2019t blindsided by these allegations. They had their rebuttals all ready to go. Thankfully beer will be safe though.  The truth is, long before this president started undermining our allies in democracy and empowering dictators, the Republican Party has been working to sell out we the people and turn control of our nation to those whose funds guarantee their re-elections. This isn\u2019t just mere kickbacks like politics of old. This is actually turning off the lights on government by, of, and for the people and turning over the keys to those who have no use for equality and who see no value in humanity.  This week the sellout became official as a majority of U.S. Supreme Court Justices voted to allow Republicans to fix elections so the results will no longer need to reflect the will of voters. With this ruling it\u2019s clear a majority of those on the court are no longer there to protect justice, but are there to intentionally obstruct it. With this ruling it\u2019s clear the very foundations of America are at risk. Now is the time for us all to object. Our highest court in the land is out of order. Now is the time for justice. Now is the time for change.  As Ronald Reagan, the Gipper himself, said so perfectly in his farewell address to the nation: \u201cAnd let me offer lesson number one about America: All great change in America begins at the dinner table.\u201d It\u2019s time for Justice to have a place at that table as a reminder of everything at stake if we fail to vote out what the Republican Party has become. Through Monday, July 1 we are offering you the chance to be among the very first to bring our new Justice to your table. Plus a pretty cool 11 x 16.5 inch Poster, too.

On Friday Sept. 21st at 6:30am, animal control employees arrived to work at the Carson/Los Angeles county animal shelter.    They found two cocker spaniels that had been tied up to the gate of the shelter parking lot.     Both dogs clearly had been outdoor dogs, matted, dirty - but one dog was emaciated and very weak.   The municipal animal shelters are not set up to operate as animal hospitals. The shelter sent the sickly dog to an outside vet to get a more thorough exam.    Camp Cocker Rescue had driven more than two hours (one way) to the Carson shelter that same day to meet both dogs and get our name on them so that we could have first chance to get them once their stray hold was up. We didn't get to meet the sickly cocker because he was already sent out to a private vet.    Later on that day, the shelter phoned us to say that the sickly dog had to be euthanized because he was suffering and was in a state of crisis.     We learned after he had been euthanized, that the private vet had said he was flea infested and severely anemic and the only way to save his life would have been a blood transfusion.     This was crushing news to us because we would have taken him to a specialty hospital to get a blood transfusion and attempted to save his life.    He was on a stray hold though and legally, the shelter was in a grey area.   If they had released the dog to us that was still on stray hold and we had done major medical treatments on him to save his life, the owners could have come forward to claim the dog and we would have been forced to return him.    That is always a gamble in these situations but we wish that the shelter had thought to call us and give us that option.     We spoke to one of the supervisors there and asked them to please let all of the staff know that in the future, if there is ever a cocker spaniel that they are considering euthanizing due to major medical, to please call us asap because we want to have the chance to step in.    In the shelter's defense, they are dealing with situations like this all of the time.   They are not set up to triage animals like an emergency animal hospital and this shelter is in a more low income area so it is common to see animals turn up at the shelter that are in dire need of medical care.    The whole thing was heartbreaking, absolutely heartbreaking. We were able to rescue the other dog and his new name is now Pumpkin.      Pumpkin is the dog on the left, his friend is the emaciated dog on the right.  Pumpkin is a skittish shy dog and this confirms our hunch that these were someone's backyard dogs that were never socialized or vetted or cared for in any way. In honor of Pumpkin's friend, whom we never met, we would like to posthumously honor him by giving him a nice name, and including his picture on our calendar for next year (we have a Rainbow Bridge section where he will be featured).     Would you like to make a small donation today in honor of Pumpkin's friend and also contribute some name suggestions?  We will be putting them all in a jar and pulling a name out so he can have the dignity of a name and a place in our calendar to remember him by. DONATIONS can be made directly here on this special donate link (there is a place to enter your name suggestions on that link):  We never met Pumpkin's friend But we knew we would have loved him This animal rescue stuff can sometimes be so hard. The best way we know how to turn our grief into something positive is by honoring Pumpkin's friend. THANK YOU so much for being a part of this special way to honor him, with your donations and with your name suggestions. Donations in honor of Pumpkin's friend will be used towards Pumpkin's medical bills (he has a dental with several extractions on the schedule).", "fin_ctg": "Not political", "targets": "Age: 30 and older\nMinAge: 30\nRegion: the United States\nGender: women\nLike\""}, {"id": "6134698578651", "title": "Feed the Children", "page": "https://www.facebook.com/feedthechildren/", "paid_for_by": "this is empty", "categories_1": "Charity Organization", "fr": 0.2222222222, "label": "np", "text": "Hunger is a major problem here in the United States.

Many of them won\u2019t make it. Nor will their deaths be mercifully quick and painless. Their eventual release will come slowly \u2013 involving agony and suffering on an unimaginable scale. But you have the power to change this. Please go to  to join the Emergency Response Team, funding the rescue and life-saving medical treatment of homeless street dogs that have nobo...dy who cares. Henrietta was only about 2 years old when she was found curled up on a street corner. All her fur was missing and her frail body was covered in painful sores. She shivered from a combination of fear and cold. We don\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been there when our Animal Rescue Officer discovered her and wrapped his arms around her. There is no government funding for these rescues. Dogs like Henrietta are completely reliant on your kindness. Please don\u2019t let them die on the streets. Join the Emergency Response Team with just a few dollars a week by going to  now. At our shelter, the vets diagnosed Henrietta with demodectic mange and severe anaemia. She needed weeks of treatment before we finally started to see her turn a corner. As she gradually realised we were not going to hurt her, her fear diminished.  As her painful skin problems healed and she recovered from her anaemia, Henrietta\u2019s spirit was transformed and we started to see the happy dog she had once been before the harsh realities of street life took over.  Your support is desperately needed to make more of these stories possible. In Thailand, hundreds of thousands of dogs suffer on the streets. Many are born there, from a mother who was also born there. Others are dumped there by callous owners, in a country where responsible pet ownership is not yet understood by many. But things are changing and with your support, so many more animals can be helped. By joining the Emergency Response Team, you will be funding increased spaying and neutering efforts, preventing unwanted pups like Henrietta being born into such cruel suffering. You will also be funding a Humane Education Programme, teaching the next generation about responsible pet ownership. Your support will also mean more suffering animals can be rescued from the streets, provided with life-saving medical care, and given a second chance at life. Henrietta now has a new future in Canada, where she will never suffer again. But countless others still suffer on the streets. Please go to  to pledge a few dollars a week for the rescue and care of homeless dogs like Henrietta.  Because if not you, who? There truly is nobody else. Please act now to show these deserving animals that you will get them the help they need. Thank you.", "fin_ctg": "Not political", "targets": "Age: 26 and older\nMinAge: 26\nActivity on the Facebook Family\""}, {"id": "6136758323545", "title": "American Indian College Fund", "page": "https://www.facebook.com/collegefund/", "paid_for_by": "this is empty", "categories_1": "Nonprofit Organization", "fr": 0.3333333333, "label": "np", "text": "Only 14% of American Indians hold a college degree.
